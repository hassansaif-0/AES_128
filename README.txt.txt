Please make sure that you must have following files in the same directory when running

AES-128 

main.py      		(main file to run for execution)
input.pt     		(Plain text in hex format to cipher )
inpkey.key    		(Key for cipher formation)
encryption.enc   		(After running main.py this will contain cipher text)
decryption.dec    	(After running this will contain text after decryption or initial plain text in Hex format)



provide the plain text in hex format in input.pt file as a single line a sample file is provided in zip
for explanation

provide the key in hex format  inputkey.key file as a single line  a sample file is provided in zip for
explanation

Moreover encryption decryption was done in micro of seconds since when code for milli second was ran
it shows 0.0 ms for encryption decryption and even  combined whole program.
